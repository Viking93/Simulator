**MobilityTestbed** is an interaction-rich simulation tool for testing and **evaluating** control mechanisms for traditional demand-responsive transport services (Dynamic Dial-A-Ride Problem) as well as next-generation flexible mobility services (exmplified e.g. by Uber or Lyft). The testbed is built on top of the [AgentPolis](http://agentpolis.com/) platform.


It allows users to:
* easily plug in **their own algorithms**, 
* run them in different realistic **benchmark scenarios**, 
* **visualize** the runs,
* discover the **weaknesses and strengths** of their algorithms
* and **compare** their **performance** with the alternatives.
